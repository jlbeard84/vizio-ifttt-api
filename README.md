# vizio-ifttt-api
Small API to control a vizio smart TV from IFTTT (or another automation tool).

## Note 

I've stopped work on this because Vizio now offers [Amazon Alexa integreation](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079GDR9P9/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1518575245&sr=1-1&keywords=vizio), which was my primary motiviation to complete this.`

## Prerequsites

node, npm

## Building

First, run `npm install` to install dependencies. From there, run `npm run build` to create deployable files in the /dist directory.

## Running locally

After building, run `npm start` to start up the app locally.

## TODO

- Deployment instructions
- Web page for administration (at least for pairing)
- Better (any) security
- Additional endpoints for additional control
